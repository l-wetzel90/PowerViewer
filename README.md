# PowerViewer
Show estimated cost of power usage

This project reads information from a .cvs file. The file is included but needs to moved to your local computer. After that the ApplianceDa class needs to be updated with the current directory for the Watts.cvs file. I have commented the line in this class that needs to be changed. 

This project was another assignment. It reads from a file with information and loads into application. It then generates a table so you can see an estimation of how much it cost per kwh to operate different appliences together. It shows calculations for hours, days and years.
